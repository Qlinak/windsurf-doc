# Client Campaign Client List Backend Plan

## Notes
- User provided detailed requirements for a client campaign client list feature, including tabs (Active, Converted, Not Interested), client card details, sales indicators, EDM status, progress, and last update info.
- Filtering, sorting, search, download (Excel), and pagination are required as per AC1-AC6.
- Project path: test_backend1, following a Prisma + NestJS fullstack backend workflow.
- .env file is required in the project root with at least DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, JWT_EXPIRES_IN.
- .env file exists and required variables are set (confirmed)
- Repository interfaces and Prisma implementation for Client created in persistence layer
- Repository interfaces for Campaign, Assignment, and Log created in persistence layer
- Prisma implementations for all repositories created in dedicated prisma subfolder
- AuthController and JWT-protected TestController scaffolded for authentication testing
- Jest unit test for AuthController created; Jest config and scripts set up

## Task List
- [x] Ensure .env file exists and is set up in project root
- [x] Parse requirements to derive Prisma schema (clients, campaigns, logs, etc.)
- [x] Create prisma/schema.prisma and ensure prisma folder exists
- [x] Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` to apply schema
- [x] Run `npx prisma generate` to generate Prisma client
- [x] Scaffold NestJS backend with DDD structure (presentation, application, domain, persistence, infrastructure)
- [x] Create domain entities (Client, Campaign, Assignment, Log)
- [x] Wire up layers (repositories, providers, JWT/auth, controllers)
- [x] Install dependencies: @nestjs/config, @prisma/client, prisma, @nestjs/jwt, passport-jwt, passport, @nestjs/passport, bcryptjs
- [x] Implement remaining repositories and infrastructure for other entities
- [x] Implement Prisma repository classes for all entities in prisma subfolder
- [x] Set up JWT authentication and providers
- [x] Scaffold AuthController and JWT-protected TestController
- [x] Set up Jest unit testing (reminder only)
- [ ] Scaffold remaining controllers and application services
- [ ] Print directory tree for verification
- [ ] Report progress after each major step

## Current Goal
Print directory tree and report progress.
